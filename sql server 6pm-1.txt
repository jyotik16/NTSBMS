Database :- 
-----------

=> a Database is a organized collection of interrelated data , for example
   a univ db stores data related to students,courses,faculty etc and a bank
   db stores data related to customers,transactions and loans etc.
 
 Types of Databases :- 
 ----------------------

 1 OLTP DB (online transaction processing)
 2 OLAP DB (online analytical processing)
 
 => OLTP db are used for storing day-to-day transactions and OLAP db are
    used for analysis.   

 => OLTP db are used to run business and OLAP db are used to analyze business

 => day-to-day operations on db includes 

   C  create
   R  read
   U  update
   D  delete 

 DBMS :-  
 --------

 => DBMS stands for database management system , it is a software used to 
    create database and used to store,read,update and delete data.

 => DBMS is an interface between user and database.

  Evolution of DBMS :-
  --------------------
    
  1960			fms (file management system)

  1970			hdbms (hierarchical dbms)
			ndbms (network dbms)

  1980			rdbms (relational dbms)

  1990			ordbms (object relational dbms)

  RDBMS :- (Relational Database Management System)
 --------------------------------------------------

  => RDBMS concepts are introduced by E.F.CODD 
  => E.F.CODD introduced 12 rules called codd rules 
  => a db software that supports all 12 rules is called perfect rdbms software
  => accroding to E.F.CODD  in db data must be organized in tables i.e. rows & cols 
 
    CUSTOMERS
    CUSTID   NAME   CITY   AGE   => columns/fields/attributes 
    100	     SACHIN MUM    40
    101      VIJAY  HYD    30
    102      RAHUL  DEL    25    => row/record/tuple

       DATABASE =  COLLECTION OF TABLES 
       TABLE    =  COLLECTION OF ROWS & COLS
       ROW      =  COLLECTION OF FIELD VALUES
       COLUMN   =  COLLECTION OF VALUES ASSIGNED TO ONE FIELD

 => every table must contain primary key to uniquely identify the records 

     EX :- ACCNO,EMPID,CUSTID,AADHARNO,PANNO
 
 RDBMS features :- 
 ---------------- 

 1 easy to access and manipulate data
 2 less redundency (duplication of data)
 3 more security 
 4 supports data integrity i.e. data quality
 5 supports data sharing  
 6 supports transactions 
  
 RDBMS softwares :- 
 ------------------

 SQL SERVER     from microsoft
 ORACLE         from oracle corp
 DB2            from IBM
 MYSQL          from oracle corp (open source db)
 POSTGRESQL     from oracle corp (open source db)

 ORDBMS :- (Object Relational DBMS)
 -----------------------------------

 => ORDBMS is the combination of RDBMS & OOPS 
  
            ORDBMS = RDBMS + OOPS (reusability)

 => RDBMS doesn't support reusability but ORDBMS supports reusability 

  ORDBMS softwares :- 
  --------------------

  oracle
  sql server
  postgresql

CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURE :-
-----------------------------

1 SERVER
2 CLIENT

SERVER :-
---------

=> server is a system where sql server software is installed and running.
=> inside the server sql server manages database.
=> inside the server sql server recieves requests from client and 
   process the requensts and sends response to client.

CLIENT :-
---------

=> using client system users 
 
 1 connects to server
 2 submit the requests to server
 3 recieves response from server

client tool :-
--------------

  SSMS  => SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO

CREATING DATABASE IN SQL SERVER :-
------------------------------------

 => In object Explorer select Databases => New Database

    Enter Database name  :-  DB6PM

 => click OK 

 => a DB is created with following two files 

   1 DATA FILE (.MDF)  (master data file)
   2 LOG FILE  (.LDF)  (log data file)

 => Data File stores data and log file stores operations 

   NAME		TYPE	 SIZE	 AUTO GROWTH	PATH
   DB6PM	DATA	 8MB	 64MB		C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\
   DB6PM_LOG    LOG      8MB	 64MB	 	C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\

command to create new database :- 
--------------------------------- 

=> open master database and execute the following command

  system database
        master  =>  New Query

   CREATE DATABASE DB10
 
Datatypes in SQL SERVER :- 
--------------------------
 
=> a datatype specifies 

   1  type of the data allowed in a column
   2  amount of memory allocated for column 

 			     	               DATATYPES 

        CHAR			INTEGER		FLOAT		CURRENCY	DATE	  BINARY

ASCII         UNICODE		tinyint		decimal(p,s)	smallmoney	date      binary
				smallint			money`		time      varbinary
char	      nchar		int						datetime  varbinary(max)
varchar       nvarchar		bigint
varchar(max)  nvarchar(max)

char(size) :- 
-------------

=> allows character data  upto 8000 chars 
=> recommended for fixed length char columns 

    ex :-  NAME  CHAR(10)

           sachin----
                  wasted 
                   
           ravi------
                 wasted 

 => in char datatype extra bytes are wasted , so char is not recommended 
    for variable length fields and char is recommended for fixed length
    fields 

     ex :-     STATE_CODE    CHAR(2)

               AP
               TS
               MH 

               COUNTRY_CODE  CHAR(3)

               IND
               USA
